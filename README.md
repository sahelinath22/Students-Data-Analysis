# 📊 Students' Data Analysis – Python EDA Project

A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook to understand student performance patterns, demographic characteristics, and lifestyle factors. This project analyzes the Student Scores dataset and uncovers meaningful insights using a range of visualizations including count plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

📁 **Project Repository Contents**

The GitHub repository includes:

1. Students’ Data Analysis.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis

2. Student Scores.csv – Raw dataset used in the analysis

3. Executive Summary – Students’ Data Analysis.pdf – Clean, structured summary of the project

4. README.md – Project documentation (you are reading it)

🚀 **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to:

1️⃣Explore the dataset thoroughly

2️⃣Identify correlations between demographic/lifestyle factors and academic performance

3️⃣Visualize meaningful insights through charts

4️⃣Highlight the factors with significant impact on student scores

5️⃣Showcase practical Python EDA skills

🧹 **Data Preparation & Cleaning**

The analysis begins with essential data cleaning steps:

1. Removal of unnamed/unnecessary columns

2. Transformation of features (e.g., converting weekly study hours categories)

3. Checking for null values

4. Preparing the dataset for visualization and interpretation

📈 **Key Insights Extracted**

🔹 **1. Gender Distribution**

Female students represent a higher proportion of the dataset.

This imbalance is considered when comparing performance across genders.

🔹 **2. Parental Education vs Student Marks**

A key highlight of this project:

Students whose parents attained higher levels of education tend to score significantly better.

Heatmap visualizations clearly show a positive correlation between parental education and student performance.

🔹 **3. Parental Marital Status**

Heatmaps indicate no notable impact of parental marital status on student academic performance.

Students' scores appear independent of whether parents are married, divorced, or separated.

🔹 **4. Ethnic Group Distribution**

The dataset includes multiple ethnic groups.

Distribution analysis helps contextualize performance differences among various groups.

🔹 **5. Sports Practice & Lunch Type**

Visual comparisons reveal:

Students who consume nutritious lunches show a higher likelihood of participating in sports.

This may indicate healthier lifestyles that potentially influence discipline and focus.

🔹 **6. Transportation Mode**

A distribution chart shows the preferred transport modes among students (e.g., bus, car, walking).

These external factors may indirectly influence fatigue, attendance, or study hours.

🧠 **Overall Conclusions**

✅Parental education level plays a major role in shaping academic performance.

✅Marital status of parents has minimal to no effect on student outcomes.

✅Lifestyle choices (sports, lunch type, transport) provide context but require deeper analysis for strong conclusions.

✅The dataset has a gender imbalance, which is important for fair comparison of results.

✅The project effectively demonstrates the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration.

🎯 **Project Value & Applications**

This EDA serves as a strong foundation for:

✅Predictive modeling of student outcomes

✅Identifying at-risk students

✅Educational policy insights

✅Understanding socioeconomic drivers of academic performance

✅Designing data-driven interventions for student improvement
